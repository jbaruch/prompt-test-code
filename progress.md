# Project Progress

## Current Phase: Specification (Phase 2)
- Phase 1 (Analysis) completed and approved
- Created directory structure for specifications
- Completed all feature files and step contracts
- Verified coverage against test scenarios
- Ready for Phase 2 review and approval

## Completed Steps
1. Project initialization and context (Phase 1)
   - Product context defined
   - Architecture decisions documented
   - Technical stack chosen
   - Requirements specified
   - Test scenarios created
   - Technical assumptions documented
   - Phase 1 approved

2. Feature Specification (Completed)
   - Created feature files:
     * Todo creation (todo_creation.feature)
     * Todo listing and filtering (todo_listing.feature)
     * Todo updating (todo_update.feature)
     * Todo deletion (todo_deletion.feature)
     * Todo details (todo_details.feature)
   - Defined step contracts:
     * TodoCreationSteps
     * TodoListingSteps
     * TodoUpdateSteps
     * TodoDeletionSteps
     * TodoDetailsSteps
   - Following Gherkin best practices
   - Using ubiquitous language
   - No implementation details
   - Complete coverage of test scenarios

## Feature Coverage
1. Todo Creation
   - Basic creation
   - Validation rules
   - Optional fields
   - Error cases

2. Todo Listing and Details
   - View all todos
   - View single todo details
   - Filtering by status
   - Sorting by priority
   - Sorting by due date
   - Empty state handling
   - Error handling (404)

3. Todo Updates
   - Field updates
   - Status changes
   - Validation rules
   - Cancel operations

4. Todo Deletion
   - Single deletion
   - Bulk deletion
   - Confirmation flow
   - Empty state handling
   - Error handling (404)

## Next Steps
Awaiting Phase 2 approval before proceeding to Implementation Phase:
1. Step definition implementation
2. Production code development
3. Scenario execution
4. Documentation updates

## Known Issues
None - all features specified according to requirements
All test scenarios covered with corresponding feature files

## Current Status: Specification Phase (STOP)
All feature files and contracts created, test scenario coverage verified, awaiting approval
