# Technical Assumptions

## 1. Storage
- Initial implementation uses in-memory storage
- No persistence across application restarts
- Future migration to persistent storage will be handled later

## 2. Concurrency
- Single-user system initially
- No concurrent write operations in v1
- No distributed system considerations yet

## 3. Performance
- Todo list expected to be small (< 1000 items)
- All operations should complete in < 500ms
- Frontend state management sufficient for this scale

## 4. Security
- No authentication/authorization in v1
- All endpoints publicly accessible
- CORS configured for local development

## 5. Error Handling
- All errors logged server-side
- User-friendly error messages on frontend
- Validation errors return 400 status
- Server errors return 500 status

## 6. Data Types
- IDs: UUID strings
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 format
- Text fields: UTF-8 encoded
- Dates: ISO 8601 format

## 7. API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- JSON request/response format
- Standard HTTP methods
- Stateless operations

## 8. Testing
- Strict phase separation:
  * Phase 2: Only feature files and contracts
  * Phase 3: Implementation and production code
- No implementation details in feature files
- Step interfaces as contracts
- Mocked dependencies in step implementations
- Spring test context for integration

## 9. UI/UX
- Mobile-first design
- Responsive breakpoints
- Immediate feedback for user actions
- Optimistic updates where possible

## 10. Development Process
- Strict adherence to phase gates
- No mixing of specification and implementation
- Feature files as living documentation
- Scenario-driven development
